Hey guys,

What's up! My name is Neil Kale, and I'm your new class president! (Yes, even for those of you who say #notmypresident)
Together, Izzie Binici, Cynthia Zhang, Sarah Cox, and I are going to be heading your class office. 
We set up this website to deliver updates about the fundraisers and other things we're doing. 
It's very important to us that you guys are involved in the student government. 
After all, you elected us. You deserve to know what we're doing.
Check back from time to time for new content!

See you around,
Neil Kale (The Prez)
